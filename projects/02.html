<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>I found <a href=" https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shabdamocharla/social-media-mental-health ">this dataset</a> on Kaggle, which provided a valuable resource for my analysis. As someone with a background in education, I’ve noticed a noticeable increase in phone usage and social media activity among users. This observation sparked my curiosity and led me to investigate the quantitative effects these platforms have on individuals. The dataset gave me a great opportunity to explore and better understand these impacts.</p>

<h2 id="exploratory-data-analysis">Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>
<p>My first task was to review the data and get a general understanding of it. I need to familiarize myself with the data and its labels to avoid any misinterpretation later, which could affect the credibility of my findings..</p>

<p>It’s also worth noting that the dataset uses the Likert Scale, which was applied to 479 participants. This scale measures various mental health effects, such as depression levels. For example, participants rate their depression on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 means minimal depression and 5 means severe depression. This standardized approach helps analyze not just depression but also anxiety, restlessness, and difficulty concentrating. By using the same scale for different factors, we can effectively compare and understand the participants' mental health.</p>

<p> Overall, the table shows that females report slightly higher levels of anxiety (3.70) compared to males (3.41). This indicates a modest gender difference in anxiety levels within the dataset. While the difference is not large, it highlights a trend where females appear to experience slightly higher anxiety on average than males.</p>

<p>Single individuals showed the highest average anxiety score at 3.79, while married individuals had the lowest, with an average of 2.85. This notable difference could be influenced by factors such as age, as married individuals are often older and may have developed greater emotional resilience. On the other hand, single individuals might experience higher anxiety levels due to societal pressures, feelings of loneliness, or uncertainty about their future. These potential contributing factors warrant further investigation to better understand the relationship between relationship status and anxiety.</p>

<p>Accurately interpreting the dataset requires recognizing potential outliers. The lone respondent over 90 with a depression score of 5 heavily influenced the results, but removing this anomaly uncovered meaningful trends. Depression levels were highest among teenagers (3.39) and young adults in their 20s (3.54), likely driven by academic stress, career uncertainty, and social pressures. In contrast, individuals aged 50-60 reported the lowest depression scores (1.88), possibly reflecting greater emotional resilience and life stability. Interestingly, despite active digital engagement, this group maintained better mental well-being, suggesting that factors beyond screen time—such as life experience and coping mechanisms—play a crucial role. These insights highlight the complex relationship between age, mental health, and digital habits, emphasizing the need for targeted mental health interventions.</p>

<p> The analysis of platform usage and its impact on sleeplessness reveals notable trends. Individuals who used more than 5 platforms had the highest average sleeplessness score of 3.69, suggesting a strong correlation between increased platform usage and poorer sleep quality. Conversely, those with fewer than 2 platforms reported a slightly lower average sleeplessness of 3.16, while those with 2 to 5 platforms experienced the least severe sleeplessness with an average score of 3.02. This suggests that excessive engagement with multiple platforms negatively affects sleep, supporting the notion that more screen time—especially across multiple apps—leads to poorer sleep quality.</p>

<p>Based on my practical experience, I hypothesized that the nature of one's workplace or educational setting would significantly influence levels of distraction. I speculated that environments with more flexibility, such as schools and universities, would afford individuals more opportunities to engage with their apps, resulting in higher distraction levels. As expected, individuals in these settings reported higher levels of distraction, with average scores of 3.5 and 3.0, respectively. On the other hand, individuals in more structured environments, like government positions, reported lower distraction levels, with an average score of 2.2. This suggests that workplace norms and expectations play a significant role in limiting or encouraging distraction</p>

<p>The findings indicate a clear correlation between the amount of time spent on social media and increased mental health concerns. Individuals who reported using social media for more than 5 hours a day had the highest average anxiety (4.03), depression (3.79), and sleeplessness (3.47). In contrast, those using social media for less than 2 hours exhibited lower scores across all metrics, with anxiety at 2.83, depression at 2.54, and sleeplessness at 2.77. These results suggest that prolonged social media usage could contribute to higher levels of mental health issues, reinforcing the importance of moderating screen time for well-being.</p>

<p>The data reveals a clear correlation between validation-seeking behavior and higher levels of both depression and self-comparison. Individuals with a stronger desire for external validation (scoring higher on the validation-seeking scale) tend to report higher average depression and self-comparison scores. Specifically, those who rated themselves as a 5 in validation-seeking exhibited the highest levels of depression (3.8889) and self-comparison (3.8148). In contrast, individuals with a lower need for validation, such as those who scored a 1, experienced notably lower levels of depression (2.8600) and self-comparison (2.1000). This suggests that an intense need for validation may exacerbate mental health concerns, particularly related to self-worth and comparison with others.</p>

<h2 id="recommendations">Recommendations:</h2>
<p>Based on the analysis of the impact of social media on mental health, here are some recommendations:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong> Limit Social Media Usage for Better Mental Health </strong>: Individuals who use more than five social media platforms show the highest levels of anxiety, depression, and sleeplessness. Limiting social media engagement to fewer platforms or setting time limits could help reduce these negative mental health impacts.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong> Focus on Digital Wellbeing in Younger Age Groups </strong>: Younger individuals, particularly teenagers and those in their 20s, reported the highest levels of depression and anxiety. Digital wellbeing programs aimed at reducing excessive social media usage for this group could improve their mental health outcomes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong> Encourage Balanced Use Across All Age Groups </strong>: Older age groups, while engaging with multiple social media platforms, reported lower levels of depression and anxiety. Promoting balanced digital engagement across age groups could help mitigate the adverse effects of social media usage, particularly among younger users.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong> Support for Single Individuals to Address Higher Anxiety </strong>: Single individuals reported higher anxiety compared to married individuals. Offering targeted support for this group, such as stress management workshops and mental health resources, can help alleviate their anxiety.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong> Promote Offline Activities to Reduce Distraction in Workplaces </strong>: People working in schools and universities, environments with fewer distractions, report higher levels of mental health concerns. Encouraging offline activities and better work-life balance could help reduce digital distractions and improve overall mental wellbeing.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
