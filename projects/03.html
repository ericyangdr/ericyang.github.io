      <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
      <p>In today’s competitive market, businesses must constantly innovate and refine their sales strategies to stay ahead. Our company recently launched a new line of office stationery designed to spark creativity and enhance brainstorming sessions. To identify the most effective sales strategy, we tested three approaches: Email outreach, Phone calls, and a combination of both (Email + Call).</p>
      <p>This project analyzes the performance of these sales methods over a six-week period, providing data-driven insights to optimize our sales efforts. By leveraging Python for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization, and introducing a custom metric to measure sales efficiency, I uncovered actionable recommendations to drive the success of our new product line.</p>

      <h2 id="problem-statement">Problem Statement</h2>
      <p>The goal of this analysis was to evaluate the effectiveness of three sales methods - Email, Call, and Email + Call in driving revenue and customer engagement. Specifically, I aimed to answer the following questions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Which sales method reaches the most customers?</li>
        <li>How does revenue vary across sales methods?</li>
        <li>Which method generates the highest revenue per unit of effort?</li>
        <li>What are the long-term trends in revenue for each method?</li>
        <li>How do customer engagement metrics (e.g., site visits, purchases) differ across methods?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>By addressing these questions, I sought to identify the most efficient and sustainable sales strategy for our new product line.</p>

      <h2 id="data-cleaning--transformation">Data Cleaning & Transformation</h2>
      <p>The dataset consisted of 15,000 rows and 8 columns, capturing details such as sales method, revenue, customer ID, and engagement metrics. Here’s how I prepared the data for analysis:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Standardizing Sales Methods:</strong> The <code>sales_method</code> column initially contained inconsistent values (e.g., "em + call" and "email"). I mapped these to three standardized values: Email, Call, and Email + Call.</li>
        <li><strong>Handling Missing Revenue Data:</strong> There were 1,074 missing values in the <code>revenue</code> column. I replaced these with the mean revenue for each respective sales method.</li>
        <li><strong>Correcting Invalid Data:</strong> Two entries in the <code>years_as_customer</code> column exceeded the company’s founding year (1984). I corrected these to the maximum possible value of 39 years.</li>
        <li><strong>Checking for Duplicates:</strong> The dataset had no duplicate rows, ensuring the integrity of the analysis.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>After cleaning, the dataset was ready for exploratory analysis.</p>

      <h3 id="customer-distribution-by-sales-method">1. Customer Distribution by Sales Method</h3>
      <p>Email reached the most customers (7,466), followed by Call (4,962) and Email + Call (2,572).</p>
      <p>This suggests that Email is the most scalable method, while Email + Call requires more effort but targets fewer customers.</p>

      <h2 id="defining-a-key-business-metric-arpse">Defining a Key Business Metric: Average Revenue per Customer Sales Effort (ARPSE)</h2>
      <p>To evaluate the efficiency of each sales method, I introduced a custom metric called <strong>Average Revenue per Customer Sales Effort (ARPSE)</strong>. This metric accounts for the effort required for each method, providing a balanced comparison of performance.</p>
      <p>The formula for ARPSE is:</p>
      <p><strong>ARPSE = Total Revenue for Method / (Number of Customers × Sales Effort)</strong></p>
      <p>Where:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Email has a sales effort of 0.5 (low effort).</li>
        <li>Email + Call has a sales effort of 1 (moderate effort).</li>
        <li>Call has a sales effort of 3 (high effort).</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="language-python highlighter-rouge">
        <div class="highlight">
          <pre class="highlight">
            <code>
              # Define the sales effort for each sales method
              sales_effort = {
                'Email': 0.5,
                'Call': 3,
                'Email + Call': 1
              }

              # Group the data by sales_method and aggregate the total revenue and number of customers
              grouped_data = sales_data.groupby('sales_method').agg({'revenue': 'sum', 'customer_id': 'count'}).reset_index()

              # Calculate ARPSE for each sales method
              grouped_data['ARCPSE'] = grouped_data.apply(lambda row: row['revenue'] / (row['customer_id'] * sales_effort[row['sales_method']]), axis=1)

              # Display the ARPSE for each sales method
              print(grouped_data[['sales_method', 'ARCPSE']])

      <h2 id="key-insights">Key Insights</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Email + Call Drives Higher Engagement:</strong> This method leads to more purchases and site visits, indicating stronger customer engagement.</li>
        <li><strong>Email is Scalable but Declines Over Time:</strong> While Email reaches the most customers, its revenue declines over time, suggesting diminishing returns.</li>
        <li><strong>Call is Less Efficient:</strong> Despite generating strong initial revenue, the Call method is the least efficient and shows a downward trend.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h2>
      <p>Based on the analysis, I recommend the following actions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Prioritize Email + Call for Long-Term Growth:</strong> This method drives higher engagement and consistent revenue growth, making it the most sustainable option.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Email for Scalability:</strong> Leverage Email to reach a broad audience, but complement it with other methods to maintain revenue.</li>
        <li><strong>Reevaluate the Call Method:</strong> Given its low efficiency and declining revenue, consider reducing reliance on this method or improving its effectiveness.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
      <p>This project demonstrates my ability to clean, analyze, and derive actionable insights from complex datasets. By introducing a custom metric (ARPSE) and combining technical analysis with business acumen, I provided a clear roadmap for optimizing sales strategies. This work highlights my proficiency in Python, data visualization, and strategic decision-making, making it a strong addition to my portfolio.
